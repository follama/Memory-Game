# Memory-Game
I created a game where you must remember and match the pairs of randomly placed cards
Initially a mini game for a group game in GameJam at my University which is why there are very few commits!

It was my first time using javascript for a project and I'm really proud of myself for creating a web based game
I also created the cards myself using canva
